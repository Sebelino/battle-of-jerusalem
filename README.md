Battle of Jerusalem
===================

Simple action game in 3D isomorphic perspective. We did this as our upper secondary school project in 2009-2010.

The game is a bit messy and largely incomplete, but I am still rather proud of it.

Usage
=====
If you are using Windows, double-click on **Run.bat**.

Run the game like so:
```bash
java BoJ
```
It that does not work, try allocating more memory:
```bash
java -Xmx1000m BoJ
```

Gameplay
========
To win, slay all the approaching nazis.

* Press X to attack.
* Press C to jump.
* Click on one of the three icons in the bottom left corner of the screen to select type of attack. The rest of the icons do not work.
* Do not bother to load the game, because there is no way to save.
